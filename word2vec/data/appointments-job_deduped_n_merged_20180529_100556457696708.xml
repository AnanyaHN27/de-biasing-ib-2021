Reporting into the group CFO and very much business partnering the Divisional MD, this role will have responsibility for running a finance function of c.50 members with 5 direct reports.

      <jobdescription>So you’ve got a specialism but you haven’t finished growing and exploring your career potential. You are not the average candidate and you are most definitely not looking for an average company to join – you want to work somewhere that shows as much potential for growth as you do and you aren’t prepared to settle for any less. As someone who brings their “A-Game” to work every single day, you expect to have an attractive benefits package, a progression path and the opportunity to be pushed outside of your comfort zone – so why settle for anything less? Harmonic may not be a name you have heard of before and that’s ok by us – we aren’t expecting that you would. In the same way that every famous athlete has a not-so-famous coach behind them pushing them to be successful we take pride in supporting out clients from the inside on some exceptional and complex programmes.

If successful in securing a role with us, you will work with our clients to successfully deliver projects/programmes, you will always be part of the Harmonic family and will be well supported, with all of the stability and benefits of a permanent job but the variation that you would see as a contractor If you are a high calibre Project Planner, a PMO Specialist, Head of PMO, Project Manager or Programme Manager at any stage of your career then we have a role for you. So, what now? Here are the important bits: Location – anywhere in the UK – you will spend most of your time working from home and client site, so if you're mobile and happy to work away from home during the week then this isn’t a blocker Salary - we have roles available at all salary levels from c.£30,000 - £95,000 per annum – we would base your salary upon your skills and experience, inline with our grading structure and we can talk to you about this at a very early stage so you can decide if its right for you How do I apply? – no lengthy and repetitive application forms here!
