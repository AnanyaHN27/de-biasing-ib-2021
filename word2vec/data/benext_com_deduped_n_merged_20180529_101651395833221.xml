      <job_title>General Practitioner - Mackay</job_title>
      <job_description>Role Type: General Practitioner - Mackay Town Information Mackay Queensland Mackay, a coastal city, is about midway between Rockhampton and Townsville and 820 km north of Brisbane. It grew into a grand city in the 1870s and 1880s with a booming sugar industry. In the 1930s it became Queensland's first regional city to have a town plan when the outer harbour was constructed. Mackay was named after the explorer John Mackay who led an expedition from Armidale, New South Wales, in search of northern grazing lands. In May 1860, after exploring inland regions, Mackay reached the Pioneer River, upon which the town of Mackay was later established. Mackay named the river after himself, and in 1862 he and a partner took up a pastoral run at Greenmount, 14 km west of Mackay, but the venture did not extend beyond the following year. Late in 1862 Governor Bowen and Commodore Burnett changed the name of the river to Pioneer, after the vessel in which they travelled, and to avoid confusion with a Mackay River at Rockingham Bay (since renamed Tully River). The following year, to placate the explorer, they named the newly established township on the south bank of the river after him. Practice information Various range of services provided include Care plans, Coal Board Medicals, Drivers Licence Medicals, Mental Health Treatment Plans, Travel, Adult and Children's Immunisations, Minor procedures. After Hours requirements Some weekend work may be applicable - 4 hours on either a Saturday or Sunday Candidate profile Full time GP to commence as soon as possible in a very busy medical practice.</job_description>
